# üöÄ RAKT's "Out-of-the-Box" Engineering Challenge üåü

Welcome to RAKT's unique and exciting way of discovering new talent. At RAKT, we believe in fun, creativity, and thinking outside the box. This challenge is your playground to showcase your skills in a way that's both enjoyable and insightful.

## üéâ Why We Do This Differently

- **Enjoy the Process**: We want you to have fun with this challenge. Think of it as a mini-hackathon where your creativity and innovation can shine.
- **Reflect Real-World Scenarios**: Just like our work at RAKT, this challenge mirrors real-world scenarios but with a twist of fun and creativity.
- **No Pressure**: Say goodbye to the traditional, high-pressure coding interviews. We're more interested in how you think and create, not just how you code under stress.

## üåê The Problem : World Needs More Food Trucks!

Our team in San Francisco are on a quest to discover the hidden gems of street food, particularly food trucks! Your challenge is to to make it possible for us to find a food truck no matter where our work takes us in the city.

This is a freeform assignment. You can write a web API that returns a set of food trucks (our team is fluent in JSON). You can write a web frontend that visualizes the nearby food trucks. We also spend a lot of time in the shell, so a CLI that gives us a couple of local options would be great. And don't be constrained by these ideas if you have a better one!

The only requirement for the assignment is that it give us at least 5 food trucks to choose from a particular latitude and longitude.

Feel free to tackle this problem in a way that demonstrates your expertise of an area -- or takes you out of your comfort zone. For example, if you build Web APIs by day and want to build a frontend to the problem or a completely different language instead, by all means go for it - learning is a core competency in our group. Let us know this context in your solution's documentation.

San Francisco's food truck open dataset is included in this repo.


## üïπÔ∏è Our Approach
- **Time Commitment:** Dedicate around three hours of focused work to this assignment. Quality matters more to us than quantity, so there's no need to overengineer your solution.
- **Real-World Simulation:** Treat this task as you would a project intended for production. Create a GitHub repository, use git for version control, and document your project in a README.md file.
- **Production-Oriented:** Your solution should reflect what you would deliver in a production environment. We understand this might limit the scope within the given time, but we prefer a production-ready approach over a feature-heavy one.
- **Documentation and Rationale:** Document your technical decisions, trade-offs, and any considerations you had. If you had more time or were to do it again, let us know what you would change or improve.
- **Flexibility in Tools and Languages:** Although our apps are primarily build on Django but you're free to use the tools you're most comfortable with, but make sure to document the setup process.

## üì¨ How to Submit Your Work
  - **Fork this Repository:** Start by forking this repository to create your own workspace.
  - **Document Your Process:** Include a README.md in your submission detailing how to set up and run your script.
  - **Comment Your Code:** Make sure your script is well-documented with comments explaining your logic and approach.
  - **Create a Pull Request:** Once you're done, submit your work by creating a pull request to this repository.
  - **Deadline:** Please submit your assignment within 5 days of receiving these instructions.
